# RatioImage
This repo contains both source code and binary files for the RatioImage package.  Binary files include those compiled for Window 64-bit, Mac OS, as well as platform independent Matlab .app file that can be used as an alternative to the source code.  

RatioImage will compute and display an intensity modulated ratiometric image. Choose a numerator and denominator image. The pixel-by-pixel ratio image will be displayed via a hue indicated by the colormap, which is user-selectable. The color brightness, however, will be modulated by the total image intensity at that pixel location. Thus, you can make ratiometric images without having to apply thresholding. Adjust the max/min displayed ratio as well as the max/min displayed intensity via sliders below and to the right of the image. Useful for FRET, Calcium ion, or other ratiometric imaging modality.
